Problem :
Read an ascii input file, reverse the contents and write the reversed contents to an output file.
Use TDD
Your unit test should not hit the file system.
Example
Input.txt contains "ABC".
After processing, output.txt should contain "CBA".
Note: This should be written in Java or Kotlin (core java, no Spring please).
